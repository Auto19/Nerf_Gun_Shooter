# Nerf_Gun_Shooter
A Face tracking nerf gun designed to annoy.

We set out on a mission to create a face tracking nerf gun and ended up with a trigger happy bot that snapped to heads.  

The Project operates off a two axis system. One motor controls the X axis and the other the Y axis.  (I would not recommend using the motors used in this build as they only work at high speeds.)  A camera is attached to the front of gun and this is how it aligns itself. It also uses a servo for the trigger which has the unintended consquence of firing every time it starts up. (If you're not expecting it, its quite a bang. Did I mention the nerf gun we used had been moded to use an airsoft spring instead of the normal nerf one.)
